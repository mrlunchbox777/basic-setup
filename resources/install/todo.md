# TODO: more curl installs

## Add repo commands

we should support some standard add repo commands for the package managers (this will require adding some stuff to schema)

* docker.io - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
* mattermost

## other curls that are less important

* azcli
* calibre
* dotnet
* golang
* kdeconnect
* lutris
* openjdk
* pwsh
* spotify
* steam
* vlc
* virtualbox as curl (specifically for redhat)...
