# Cheatsheet Index

`cs` is an alias for `cheatsheet`

If you are new, everything in these cheatsheets is worth learning at at least a surface level. Use `tldr` and `man` to help along the way.

## `cs` commands

There is a reserved command to get all of the cheatsheets as a single doc - `cs all`.

These can be composited as a single string argument.

* `cs bi` will show cheatsheet base and then cheatsheet index
* `cs ib` will show cheatsheet index and then cheatsheet base

The default command (when no string is provided) is index

* `a` - alias
* `b` - base
* `c` - complication
* `d` - docker
* `g` - general -- shared scripts
* `i` - index
* `k` - kubernetes
* `m` - metrics -- performance & telemetry
* `n` - networking
* `p` - process manipulation
* `s` - system -- backend
* `t` - text manipulation

Did you mean `cs b`?
